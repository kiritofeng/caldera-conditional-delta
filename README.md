# caldera-conditional-delta

Conditional Delta Plugin for Caldera Forms.

Essentially, a more powerful version of the built-in Caldera-Increment, that works with conditionals, and can have additional parameters set, such as min and max values, and a custom delta value.

## Personal Rant

This was some of the worst brain-damage I have made myself endure.
I *cannot* stress enough how unenjoyable this process was.

![Obligatory XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pain_rating.png)

Yes, I had to re-calibrate my personal scale for pain over these two files.

## Features

1. Allows for a delta that is *not equal to 1*.
2. Allows for conditional activation.
3. Allows for a maximum and minimum value to be set.

Also includes all features of Caldera-Increment, only... you know... they work...

## Getting Started

Download and zip the two `.php` files, and then upload over the WordPress plugin upload menu.
