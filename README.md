**Note: This repository is now archived, as it is part of my personal fork of Caldera Forms.**

Conditional Delta Plugin for Caldera Forms.

Essentially, a more powerful version of the built-in Caldera-Increment, that works with conditionals, and can have additional parameters set, such as min and max values, and a custom delta value.

## Features

1. Allows for a delta that is *not equal to 1*.
2. Allows for conditional activation.
3. Allows for a maximum and minimum value to be set.

Also includes all features of Caldera-Increment, only... you know... they work...

## Getting Started

Download and zip the two `.php` files, and then upload over the WordPress plugin upload menu.
